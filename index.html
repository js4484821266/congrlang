            <h1>CongrLang</h1>
            Congruence Language (or "CongrLang" for short)
            is a constructed language where all words,
            and inflections are natural numbers and the morphology
            is based on modulo arithmetic.
            The inflections are rendered as sequences of
            readable syllables by versions.
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            This constructed language is based on the idea of
            a language where the morphology is so complex that
            it is considered completely irregular.
            <h2>Morphology</h2>
            The inflection of a word is the least natural
            number congruent to the power of the primitive
            form of the word. The methodology accords with
            the specific expression.
            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            The syntax implements the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
